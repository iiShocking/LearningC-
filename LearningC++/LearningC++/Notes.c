/* 
C++ is a cross platform language, developed as an extension to the 'C' language
C++ gives a high level of control over memory and resources
C++ is an OOP language, allowing easily reusable code

Some popular C++ IDEs are: Visual Studio, Code::Blocks and Eclipse

Syntax Related Notes:
C++ ignores blank space
C++ uses curly brackets {} to enclose code
Every statement ends with a semi-colon ';'
\n Creates a new line
\t Creates a horizontal tab
\\ Inserts a backslash
/" Inserts a double quote
Comments are started with '//'
Multi-line comments are with /*



General Notes:
C++ works top-down meaning any function created after the line it's called in will be undetected unless defined prior
cout is used for output, using the insertion operator '<<'
cin is used for input, using the extraction operator '>>'
C++ has 0-based indexing
Including std namespace is personal preference, you can just use std:: before respective uses
Strings can be made with either string library or char arrays, the latter being used due to C specific methods available to it

Variables:
int - stores whole numbers ; 2 or 4 bytes
float - stores floating point numbers - 4 bytes
double - stores floating point numbers - 8 bytes ... double has higher precision than a float .. can be used with E to indicate to the power of 10
char - stores single characters - 1 byte ... must be surrounded by single quotes '' .. ASCII values can be assigned
string - stores text - list of chars ... must be surrounded by double quotes ""
bool - stores true / false value - 1 byte ... Printing a bool prints 0 , 1
